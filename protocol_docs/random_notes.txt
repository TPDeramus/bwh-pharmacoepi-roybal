 
Studying what needs to be done on my end/blue coding boxes, I’m just going to start to flesh out things and make sure I’m on the right track with my ‘studying’:
Join by user ID (i.e. send results of whether the patient opened pill bottle etc.): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/personalizer/concept-rewards
Create context vectors (i.e. feed in information to Personalizer): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/personalizer/concepts-features\
Choose message (i.e. rank request to determine the message from Personalizer): https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/python/api/azure-cognitiveservices-personalizer/azure.cognitiveservices.personalizer.models.rankrequest?view=azure-python (Not 100% sure if this is the appropriate documentation for this conceptually or if there is additional documentation that I’m not finding regarding rank calls)
Let me know if this is where these general outline of events/coding sit in the pipeline or if it seems like my thought process is at all confused!
 
Also just adding those two links that Marco sent in the chat to this email chain for future reference:
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/personalizer/ (Attached a PDF version of Personalizer Documentation)
https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/cognitive-services/personalizer/sdk-learning-loop?pivots=programming-language-python (Super helpful!)
